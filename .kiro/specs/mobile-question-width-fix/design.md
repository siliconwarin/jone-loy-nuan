# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the mobile question text width issue by implementing responsive width constraints that provide better text readability on mobile devices. The solution focuses on optimizing the existing QuestionSection component and its container layout to utilize available screen space more effectively while maintaining the current design aesthetic.

## Architecture

The fix involves two main components:

1. **QuestionSection Component** (`app/quiz/_component/question-section.tsx`) - Contains the question text styling
2. **Quiz Client Container** (`app/quiz/_component/quiz-client.tsx`) - Contains the wrapper that constrains the QuestionSection width

The current architecture uses a nested container approach:

```
quiz-client.tsx (outer container with max-width)
  └── question-section.tsx (inner text with max-width)
```

## Components and Interfaces

### QuestionSection Component

**Current Implementation Issues:**

- `max-w-[300px]` is too restrictive for mobile devices
- Text truncation occurs with `line-clamp-2`
- Insufficient horizontal space utilization

**Design Solution:**

- Increase mobile max-width to utilize more screen space
- Implement progressive width scaling: mobile → tablet → desktop
- Maintain existing responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg)
- Preserve text centering and padding

### Quiz Client Container

**Current Implementation:**

- Container has `max-w-[340px]` on mobile
- Uses responsive scaling: `340px → md → lg`

**Design Solution:**

- Increase mobile container width to provide more space
- Ensure container and text widths work harmoniously
- Maintain existing layout proportions

## Data Models

No data model changes required. This is purely a UI/styling enhancement.

## Error Handling

**Responsive Design Fallbacks:**

- Ensure graceful degradation on very small screens (< 320px)
- Maintain readability if content exceeds container bounds
- Preserve existing animation and transition behaviors

**Testing Considerations:**

- Verify text doesn't overflow on edge cases
- Ensure animations remain smooth with new dimensions
- Test across various mobile device sizes

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing

1. **Device Testing:**

   - iPhone SE (375px width)
   - iPhone 12/13 (390px width)
   - Android small (360px width)
   - Android medium (412px width)

2. **Orientation Testing:**

   - Portrait mode readability
   - Landscape mode adaptation

3. **Content Testing:**
   - Short questions (< 50 characters)
   - Medium questions (50-100 characters)
   - Long questions (> 100 characters)

### Automated Testing

- Visual regression tests for question display
- Responsive breakpoint validation
- Animation integrity checks

## Implementation Details

### Responsive Width Strategy

```css
/* Current mobile constraint */
max-w-[300px] sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg

/* Proposed mobile enhancement */
max-w-[90vw] sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg
/* OR */
max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)] sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg
```

### Container Coordination

```css
/* Quiz Client Container */
max-w-[90%] sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg

/* Question Section Text */
max-w-full /* inherit from parent container */
```

### Padding and Spacing

- Maintain existing padding: `px-2 sm:px-3 md:px-4`
- Preserve line height: `leading-tight`
- Keep text centering: `text-center`

## Design Decisions and Rationales

1. **Viewport-based Width:** Using `90vw` or `calc(100vw-2rem)` ensures consistent spacing across devices while maximizing text space.

2. **Container-first Approach:** Adjusting the outer container width is cleaner than complex inner text constraints.

3. **Preserve Existing Breakpoints:** Maintaining `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints ensures no regression on tablet/desktop.

4. **Animation Compatibility:** Changes focus on static dimensions to avoid affecting existing Framer Motion animations.

5. **Progressive Enhancement:** Mobile-first approach that enhances larger screens rather than constraining smaller ones.
