# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the mobile user experience issue where quiz question text is being cut off or wrapped awkwardly due to insufficient width constraints on mobile devices. The current implementation limits question text to 300px on mobile, causing poor readability and text truncation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user taking the quiz, I want question text to display with adequate width so that I can read questions without awkward word breaks or text truncation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views quiz questions on mobile devices THEN the question text SHALL have sufficient width to prevent unnecessary word wrapping
2. WHEN question text is displayed on mobile THEN the text SHALL maintain readability without being cut off
3. WHEN the screen width is less than 640px THEN the question container SHALL utilize more available horizontal space
4. WHEN question text exceeds the container width THEN it SHALL wrap naturally at appropriate word boundaries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want consistent text presentation across different mobile screen sizes so that the quiz experience remains professional and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on small mobile devices (320px-480px) THEN question text SHALL have appropriate padding and width
2. WHEN viewing on medium mobile devices (480px-640px) THEN question text SHALL utilize available space effectively
3. WHEN question text wraps to multiple lines THEN line height and spacing SHALL maintain readability
4. WHEN transitioning between portrait and landscape orientations THEN question text SHALL adapt appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the quiz interface, I want responsive design patterns that scale appropriately so that the UI remains consistent across all device sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing width constraints THEN the solution SHALL use responsive design principles
2. WHEN modifying mobile layouts THEN existing tablet and desktop layouts SHALL remain unaffected
3. WHEN updating question styling THEN the changes SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing animations and transitions
4. WHEN testing across devices THEN the question display SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and design consistency
