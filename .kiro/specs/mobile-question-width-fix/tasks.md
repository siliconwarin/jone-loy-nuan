# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update QuestionSection component mobile width constraints

  - Modify the max-width classes in question-section.tsx to use viewport-based sizing for mobile
  - Replace `max-w-[300px]` with `max-w-[90vw]` or `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` for mobile breakpoint
  - Ensure existing sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints remain unchanged
  - Test that text centering and padding remain consistent
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Adjust quiz client container width to coordinate with question text

  - Update the container div in quiz-client.tsx that wraps QuestionSection
  - Change `max-w-[340px]` to `max-w-[90%]` or similar responsive approach
  - Ensure container and text widths work harmoniously together
  - Verify existing responsive breakpoints (sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg) still function
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Test responsive behavior across mobile device sizes

  - Create test cases for various mobile viewport widths (320px, 360px, 375px, 390px, 412px)
  - Verify question text displays without awkward wrapping on each device size
  - Test both portrait and landscape orientations
  - Ensure text remains readable and properly centered
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Validate animation and transition compatibility

  - Test that existing Framer Motion animations continue to work smoothly
  - Verify question exit animations maintain proper timing and visual effects
  - Ensure showResult state transitions don't cause layout shifts
  - Check that motion.h2 element animations remain intact
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Cross-browser and device testing validation

  - Test implementation on iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, and Android browsers
  - Verify consistent behavior across different mobile operating systems
  - Ensure no regression on tablet (768px+) and desktop (1024px+) layouts
  - Validate that existing design hierarchy and visual consistency are maintained
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.2, 3.4_
